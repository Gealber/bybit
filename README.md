# Bybit client

Personal implementation of bybit [api documentation](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/), a lot of missing methods and others custom implementations.
It can be easily extended. Example of it's use can be found in `example.go` file. Feel free to modify all this at your convenience.
